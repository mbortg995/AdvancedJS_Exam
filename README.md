# AdvancedJS Exercise
AdvancedJS deliverable and scoring exercise, where I have to make a webpage to buy tickets for a specific event v√≠a third party API.

## Brief description
This exercise consists of three elements: A JS file, an HTML and finally a CSS.

The HTML serves as the link connecting all three elements, including references to the other two. It already contains part of the layout.

The JS (main.js), is in charge of the logic of the entire program, even having to spend DOM to bring elements from the HTML and create new ones.

We start applying the basic principles of connecting to APIs via endpoints and make our first attempt at using the HTTP POST method. This is wrapped in a "try/catch" block to confirm the purchase or, alternatively, display an error message.

The elements displayed on the web page related to the event (header image, name and description, date, number of tickets) are derived from the initial information obtained through a fetch request to the API endpoint.

The CSS aims to add some styling to the entire setup.
